You will first need to knead the dough into a ball
Then roll the balled dough into a big pizza shape
Take your alfredo sauce and spread it onto the dough
Sprinkle lots of mozzarela on top
Neatly lay the sausages on the cheese
Do the same for the mushrooms
You then want to bake the pizza until it is ready to eat
Melt your butter in a microwave
Take a brush, put it in the butter, then brush the melted butter on top of your pizza
Then sprinkle your oregano on top for the finish
Then your pizza is done
